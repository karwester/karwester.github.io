Hello! I'm Karolina and, among other things, I enjoy doing data analysis. This is my space to share what I'm working on.

If you have an idea and want to see if I'd be interested in helping out, please contact me.

And if you ever find yourself at this tram stop, do yourself a favour and get a rurka from the ice-cream shop.
