Hello! My name is Karolina and I enjoy working with data. This is my space to share what I'm working on.

<!-- working at Booz Allen Hamilton as a Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on <b>Natural Language Processing </b> and <b>model deployment.</b> -->

<!-- I also do pro-bono strategic consulting work with [Compass.](https://compassprobono.org/) I am currently assisting on a growth strategic proposal to a nonprofit firm.

I am always looking for folks who are interested in aiding on ongoing or newly created projects. -->

If you have an idea and want to see if I'd be interested in helping out, please contact me!
