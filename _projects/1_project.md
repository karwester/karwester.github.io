This project is geared toward highlighting the theory and applications for popular traditional Data Science methods that you typically see taught in Undergraduate or Master/PHD programs. This [Data Science Github](https://github.com/SpencerPao/Data_Science) encompasses the current methods I had completed.

<!-- ***

A little bit about me. I love watching TV; I like Football and Basketball; I love the UFC MMA. Hopefully, that doesn't scare you. :smirk:

#### A Small Bucket List (Will grow in the future)
<ul>
    <li>Attend a UFC match.</li>
    <li>Visit the 7 modern and ancient wonders of the world.</li>
</ul>

Also, has anyone actually worn a hoodie and feel warm? Not me.

Did I mention I love quotes related to life? Here's one that sticks with me.
